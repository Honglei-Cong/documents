## Celer and L4 collaborating

on the development of open-source state channels technology.

Shared goals:

* Learn from each other's contrasting design decisions
* Develop shared standards for encoding off-chain state, connecting generalized state channels into networks, developer interfaces, and more.
* Collaborate on cutting-edge research, including zero-knowledge state channel designs, formal verification of generalized state channel models.


### Shared standards

* Maximizing privacy in state channel designs through solutions like minimal on-chain footprints and zero knowledge dispute resolution proofs.
* Minimizing on-chain state bloat through contract design that uses smart selections of cryptographic data structures.
* Providing expertly optimized, formally verified, and high audited components that developers of decentralized applications can rely on without repeatedly re-inventing the wheel.
* Support for multiple parallel operations inside of a single channel that do not interfere with each other.
* Finding the right balance between full-featured on-chain smart contracts with simple off-chain interaction and minimal on-chain presence with full upgradability.


### Collaborative research on new tech

* Zero knownledge state channel applications
* Using ZK proofs in dispute state
* Using hashladders instead of HL registers to minimize dispute costs
* Formal verification of generalized state channel models
* Optmimizing the on-chain contract layer while preserving some 'out of the box' features
