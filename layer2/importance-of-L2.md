### Scaling 


Sharding

* in distributed databases, sharding solutions are quite complex
* cross-shard transactions, can dominate the overall system


If differnt asset in differnt sharding, a significate number of cross-shard transactions can be expected.


### Layer2

To achieve amortized cost:  The more transactions, the lower the cost per transaction.

In current cryptocurrencies, the more transactions, the higher the cost per transaction.


* To use blockchain as an anchor of trust, instead of as a generalized state machine.
* More than as payment channels, Layer2 is also off-chain computation and hiding complex scripts inside signatures, or using zero-knownledge contingent payments.
* Interoperability between different blockchains
