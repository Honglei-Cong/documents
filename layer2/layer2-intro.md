## Layer2 Network


Issues with root blockchains
* scale
* high gas price
* questionable privacy
* no compromise on decentralization

Layer2 blockchain, often referred as an ‘off-chain’ solution.
* scale blockchain transaction capacity while retaining the decentralization benefits

To balance the needs of security, decentralization and scalability
* rely on root blockchain as a base layer of security and finality
* add smart contracts on the main blockchain protocol that interact with activities off-chain

Layer1 : serves as security layer that anchors data transaction in a way that is immutable, cryptographically secured without a central authority.

Layer2 : massively cut down data processing on the blockchain by running computations off-chain.  The base chain will still be the ultimate judge when there are disputes.
* minimize the amount of data storage on the base layer

Layer2 provides those BaseLayer alone cant do
* make blockchain systems usable
* scale with whatever industry they’re implemented for
* compete with the likes of established, centralized system

Layer2, compared with sharding
* new amount of entrance
* new amount of exits 
* new amount of dispute resolutions

Miners may be hurt by activity going off chain.

True innovation, by definition, is disruptive.

Bitcoin’s peak is around 425K transactions per day and Ethereum’s is 1.4 million. But Twitter has 150 million daily active users, and Facebook has 1.4 billion.
