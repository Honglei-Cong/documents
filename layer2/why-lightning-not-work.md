## Lighting Network Will not Work



#### Example from Lykke (payment channel)

1. client held their money in payment channels in order to keep the control over their money
2. client made a payment transaction transferring money to the exchange inside the payment channel without recording this transaction on blockchain.


Lykke served as a liquidity hub for all its clients.


We also predicted that sooner or later our capital won't be enough and from time to time it would be necessary to close channels with clients in order to unblock our BTC to use them in other channels.


Apparently I can tell that the costs of liquidity hub are growing exponentially with the opening of each new channel.  Thus the same for the Lightning Network.

The Lightning Network is not scalable in terms of the number of simultaneously opened channels for each single payment hub.


So let's try to imagine could the current Lightning Network serve, for instance 100 millions of LN wallets owned by ordinary clients?  

Obviously no, because in average one single hub would need to handle more than 30K channels. 
This much more than even Lykke used to have.


So how many liquidity hubs are required to have in LN? Maybe 10k? Or 100k?  Unfortunately even 1M LN hubs won't be enough because on avarage each node will have to server 100 channels.
