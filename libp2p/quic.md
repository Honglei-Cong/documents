## QUIC

QUIC (quick udp internet protocol)

1. implemented in user space
2. multiplex-stream
3. tcp fast-open liked, not handshake
4. FEC: 
    1. tcp need timeout to determine if packet lossed, 
    2. QUIC based on FEC, some small packets associated with one checksum


Thereâ€™s no stream on UDP, this is the big advantage for concurrent transmission and multiplexing stream compared with TCP.
Quic is http over UDP.
