## Generalized State Channel


Goal:

* Design a generialized state channels implementation that preserves privacy, is built using modular components, has support for multiple parallel operations inside a single channel, and allows users to upgrade channel designs without any on-chain operations.
* Make it easy for developers to utilize state channels by providing a framework and standard modular components for building secure, performant applications.


**Places as little on-chain as possible while still remaining secure**


#### Terminology

**State Deposit**
locking up some portion of blockchain state into a multisig contract, controlled by a defined set of participants.

**Unanimous Consent**
All parties sign each off-chain transaction.

**Instant Finality**
For this reason, state channels offer 'instant' transactions -- i.ie, parties do not have to wait for blockchain confirmations.
An application can *immediately* consider an operation finalized and display that to user.

**Refer back to the Blockchain only when Necessary**
If anything goes wrong, all parties always have the option to deploy the latest version of the state to the blockchain.
