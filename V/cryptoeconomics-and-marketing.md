#### What is Cryptoeconomics

* first of all, is economics.
* specialized to a particular set of circumstances
    * Not exactly to the standards of a court judge
    * but exactly to the standards of a computer programmer
* Lots of things that you can’t do
    * e.g. forbidden bribe: he can do that outside of the protocol
    * e.g. rules for rewarding and penalising: must be done by smart contract
    * actors are anonymous
* Cryptoeconomics is basically taking economic with those particular constraints and then adding together insights from fields that are fairly close by to the cryptocurrency space.


#### trying to figure out

**given these contraints and given these building blocks, what kind of systems and what kind of mechanisms can be design to achieve the properties that we want?  And under what kinds of assumptions do those properties hold?**

speaker/listener fault equivalence

* If the protocol requires Alice to send a message to Bob, and the protocol detects that Bob never showed a message from Alice, then the protocol knows that either it is because Alice forgot to speak or it is because Bob pretended not to listen.


**What is a blockchain’s unique competitive advantage? What are things that you can do with blockchains that can do only with more difficulty without them?**

Trying to go from there and zero in and try to figure out exactly what industries and what kind of applications in those industries should be going after.

#### Decentralization
* architectural decentralization
* political decentralization
* logical decentralization

#### blockchain is 
* architectual decentralized (not run on one piece of hardware)
* political decentralized (not run by one single person or small cabal of people at the same time)
* but not logical decentralized (one blockchain, one shared ledger)

#### Possible Tech Breakthrough
* base-layer scalability
* state channels

#### Cryptocurrency’s valuation
* net present value of the transaction fees that it is getting
* model of store of value
    * people hold it because they expect more people to hold it in the future, and because people keep getting richer and the population keeps growing.  As long as prices grow slow enough, it can be stable in the long term.
